      <h1 role="heading">About Arch Women</h1>
      <p>The goal of Arch Women is to foster female involvement in Arch Linux 
      and Free Open Source Software. The community is open to female Linux 
      enthusiasts and users, and to the people who support them. If you would like 
      to join us, please have a look at our community standards to get a feel 
      for how our community is run.</p>
      <p>Arch Women has a monthly IRC meeting on the first Sunday of every month. 
      They generally run for about 2 hours and start at 16:00 UTC.</p>
      <p>The Arch Women <a href="/blog">Blog</a> is a place to discuss and share 
      information in a contained and moderated way. <a href="/blog/submit">Submissions</a> 
      are welcome from anyone who would like to share something.</p>
      <p>The #archlinux-women channel was created to provide a "safe space" for 
      people to chat without the need to hide their gender or sexual identity. 
      We also have other ways you can <a href="/contact">contact us</a>.</p>
      <h2 role="heading">Mission Statement</h2>
      <p>Archlinux can be daunting at first for many newcomers, and most general
      communities are not always welcoming towards minorities, or sometimes not
      welcoming at all. As a result of these aggressive environments, minorities are
      discouraged and even occasionally excluded from certain communities.</p>
      <p>Arch Women aims to provide a welcoming community to those interested in Archlinux,
      with a focus on women. We work to encourage the use and contribution to the Archlinux,
      Linux and other related projects by women and other minorities in the tech world.</p>
      <p>To accomplish this, we provide a "safe haven" for minorities, in our <code>#archlinux-women</code>
      IRC channel, where we maintain friendly discussion and condemn any discriminatory speech
      or trolling. We host Linux-related classes in <code>#archlinux-classroom</code>. We also
      hold monthly meetings where we discuss what we can do to help minorities in tech and how
      we can contribute to Archlinux.
      </p>
      <p>Arch Women does not aim to be a separate community from the Archlinux community, but rather
      a safe place for minorities <em>within</em> the Archlinux community. This allows us to contribute
      directly to the Archlinux project.
      </p>
      <h2 role="heading">History</h2>
      <p>Arch Women was founded in February 2012 by Dolores Portalatin - 
      "meskarune". It sprang from an IRC conversation in #archlinux-offtopic about 
      how few women openly contribute to the Arch Linux community. From there an 
      IRC channel (#archlinux-women) was created for planning, a few long time Arch 
      Linux users joined in, and two days later the main website was up and running. 
      Since that time, Arch Women has changed servers twice and tripled in membership.</p>
