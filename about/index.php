        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Arch Women was founded in February 2012 by Dolores Portalatin &emdash; 
        "meskarune". It sprang from an IRC conversation in #archlinux-offtopic about 
        how few women openly contribute to the Arch Linux community. From there an 
        IRC channel (#archlinux-women) was created for planning, a few long time Arch 
        Linux users joined in, and two days later the main website was up and running. 
        Since that time, Arch Women has changed servers twice and tripled in membership.</p>
